Pterosaurs have zero relation to bats. In fact, bats are probably one of the furthest from pterosaurs on the evolutionary chain, being down a completely separate path from reptiles. It does make some sense, though, that flying reptiles may take after bats. Very few animals that aren’t birds can fly, and bats are the only non-bird animals that can actually fly, rather than glide. It makes some sense that the only extant animal with this feature would look similar to flying reptiles. But Jehelopterus just straight up looks like a flying rat. It had fluffy fur-like feathers, hunted at night, and some theorize that it used its tiny, needlelike teeth to feed on blood, although evidence is slim regarding that. You may wonder how such a small animal would preserve as well as it did, and that is due in large part to this animal being from the Jehol formation. This formation is famous for holding some of the best preserved fossils, managing to preserve some species that would be unlikely to ever fossilize, even in perfect conditions.
