The reason why Kaprosuchus is nicknamed the “boar crocodile” is due to its tusk-like snaggleteeth that stuck out vertically from its mouth. Its teeth had several mammalian traits, leading to initial descriptions to believe it may have been one, but in reality it was a crocodylomorph - a crocodile. But having mammalian traits as a crocodile isn’t the main reason Kaprosuchus made this list. Within crocodylomorphs, there isn’t much difference between primitive species and contemporary ones. Evolution got it right on the first try, so there was never any real need to change up what worked. Kaprosuchus did something completely different. Kaprosuchus made this list because it could run, and fast. Kaprosuchus likely hunted on land more often than it did in the water, galloping on long legs rather than the typical short stubby legs made for swimming that most crocodylomorphs have. Some theories state that it could run as fast as a cheetah. Let’s count our lucky stars that cheetah-crocs died out, as this was an evolutionary experiment that I would never want to see in real life.
