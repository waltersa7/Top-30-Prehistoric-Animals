<p><strong>Name: </strong>Yutyrannus huali, “beautiful feathered tyrant”</p>
<p><strong>Family: </strong>Tyrannosauridae (large carnivorous theropods, like a T. Rex)</p>
<p><strong>Lived: </strong>Early Cretaceous (125 million years ago), its range is unknown but it did live in China</p>
<p><strong>First Described: </strong>2012, China</p>
<p><strong>Size: </strong>Approx. 10ft tall and 29.5ft long, and weighed 3,100lbs </p>
<hr>
<p>In 2012, a complete adult specimen of Yutyrannus was found alongside two juveniles. These fossils were unique in that they are tyrannosaurid, but their fossils bore indisputable proof that these animals had defined plumage. It is theorized that this plumage was intended to survive the cold, demonstrating that these warm-blooded reptiles could thrive in the cold, contrary to popular belief. One thing that remains contentious in paleontology is the idea of feathered tyrannosaurids. It’s generally understood that most tyrannosaurids had little to no feathering as they wouldn’t have needed them for temperature regulation, but Yutyrannus had plenty. Having the presence of juveniles also allowed for comparisons with the adult, so we know how they grew.  This discovery also gave us insights into the social lives of these animals, with the presence of an adult and two juveniles implying that these animals made good parents and hunted in packs, indicating social intelligence. Sauropod material was also discovered alongside them, leading to theories that they were sauropod killers (as tyrannosaurids tended to be, this was their ecological niche and the reason they were so large), and may have been killed by a sauropod (although their cause of death remains inconclusive). If this is true, that would make them one of two sauropod killers in the Yixian formation, the other being currently undescribed. Also, Yutyrannus was also described by Xu Xing. </p>
