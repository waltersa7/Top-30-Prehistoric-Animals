    <p><strong>Name: </strong>Deinocheirus mirificus, “peculiar terrible hand"”</p>
    <p><strong>Family: </strong>Ornithomimisauridae (theropods which superficially resemble modern day birds like ostriches)</p>
    <p><strong>Lived: </strong>Late Cretaceous (70 million years ago), found in Asia first, but later discovered in Europe, North America, and possibly Africa</p>
    <p><strong>First Described: </strong>1970, Mongolia</p>
    <p><strong>Size: </strong>Approx. 11ft tall and 36ft long, and weighed over 14,000 lbs (Yes, you read all of that correctly.)</p>
<hr>
    <p>An incredibly strange dinosaur known largely for its unique resemblance to waterfowl, but way bigger. There are no other species found within its genus, and nobody really knows what was up with them and why they looked the way they did, nor do we know for sure if modern waterfowl descend directly from them (although they likely do share some ancestry). What we do know is that these animals were LARGE, some of the largest ever lived, with 8ft long arms and a skull which is almost 3ft long. They were bigger than a T. rex! Add on top of that their large claws, resembling that of a Therizinosaurs. This animal would have been a killing machine, had it not been a fairly peaceful herbivore that kept to mossy swamps and raked up weeds and water plants from the bottoms of shallow lakes. Parts of two specimens were stolen from Mongolia in 2014, but have since been recovered. These two specimens had large implications for our understanding of this dinosaur, as they were the described specimens who revealed that they were more duck-like than ostrich-like, despite their ornithomimosaur status.</p>
