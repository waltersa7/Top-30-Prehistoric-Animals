Andrewsarchus is an interesting early mammalian carnivore for a few reasons. For one, they are cetaceans meaning that they are actually most closely related to whales. They also share a relative with Enteledonts, which were carnivorous pigs. Despite looking quite canine, Andrewsarchus was almost certainly an ungulate. Due to them being related to whales so closely, they may have also been fairly intelligent. Paleontologists are unsure if Andrewsarchus was primarily a predator or a scavenger, but it is certain that its teeth could do some damage. Its teeth were built for crushing, not slicing, and considering the fact that it had one of the largest skulls found of a terrestrial animal, it likely had a nasty bite force.
