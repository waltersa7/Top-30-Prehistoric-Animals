<p><strong>Name: </strong>Palaeophis colossaeus, "colossal ancient snake”</p>
<p><strong>Family: </strong>Serpentes (snakes)</p>
<p><strong>Lived: </strong>Eocene epoch (56 to 34 million years ago), the Tethys Sea, which is now North Africa</p>
<p><strong>First Described: </strong>1841, England</p>
<p><strong>Size: </strong>Up to 40ft long, and weighed approx. 2,500lbs. No diameter measurements are available due to generally low interest from potential describers</p>

Palaeophis were strictly aquatic animals, as fossils have only ever been found in known marine strata (that means they have only been found in geological layers known to have been underwater at the time). Unfortunately, most Cenozoic species, especially aquatic ones, suffer from disinterest from paleonologists. Many fossils never get the chance to be described because, simply, they aren’t dinosaurs. I disagree with this notion, as I have always felt that Cenozoic species were equally interesting. My opinion is not shared by most paleontologists, though, and Palaeophis remains relatively understudied and unknown. The most striking feature of this sea snake was its size. While not the longest snake to ever live (that honor goes to Titanaboa), it was the longest sea snake. In fact, it was so large that it was known to hunt whales. Granted, whales were, at the time, not the beasts they are today. They had freshly entered the water and would not have been the size they are today. However, that isn’t to say they were small, they were still some of the largest animals within their ecosystems - sizable enough to evade most mesopredators, but Palaeophis was no mesopredator; it was apex.
