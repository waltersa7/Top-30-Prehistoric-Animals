This is the most famous of the long-clawed dinosaurs; there are several, but most do not reach the length of Therizinosaurus’. Its claws were longer than most swords at 3ft long, and could certainly do damage in a fight. It wouldn’t have actually used its claws as often as one may assume as they were somewhat brittle and breaking them could spell death for the animal. This is because Therizinosaurus was not a carnivore, it was a peaceful herbivore, and it didn’t use its claws to kill, but to eat. It raked fibers and berries from ground plants with its claws, and breaking one would mean it could no longer feed as effectively. Another interesting aspect of this dinosaur is that it was originally thought to have been a turtle, hence its name meaning “scythe turtle mimic”. Therizinosaurus actually has one of the most different modern understandings compared to its original description that we know of.
