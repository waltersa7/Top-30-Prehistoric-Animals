Amargasaurus is a dinosaur that has faced a lot of controversy regarding large spines that run down its neck. While some paleontologists say that the spines denote the existence of a sail or some other soft tissue display, others say that they may not have had any soft tissue, but were spikes, as evidenced by their V shape, similar to that of a stegosaurid thagomizer (tail spikes). It is also similarly debated, assuming they were, indeed, spikes, whether they were for defense or display. Another striking feature of Amargasaurus is its size. While being 33ft long and 10ft tall is nothing to scoff at, they are dwarfed by the majority of sauropods. This may have been the reason for defensive spikes - it needed to defend itself, because it couldn’t rely on it’s size.
