<p><strong>Family: </strong>Testudinidae (turtles)</p>
<p><strong>Lived: </strong>Campanian era (80 to 74 million years ago), in the Western Interior Seaway, an inland sea which is now known as the Great Plains of North America</p>
<p><strong>First Described: </strong>1895, South Dakota</p>

Archelon was a sea turtle which inhabited the Western Interior Seaway, living alongside plesiosaurs, seabirds like hesperornis, and apex predators like Mosasaurus. Despite being a sea turtle, Archelon had a leathery carapace similar to contemporary Leatherback Turtles. It also had a hooked beak, more so than most contemporary turtles, possibly a form of convergent evolution with dinosaurs, who also had beaks. This beak is theorized to have been used to shear flesh, making this turtle potentially an active predator rather than an opportunistic one. They also would have eaten jellyfish, squids, and nautilus nearer to the surface. However, most of their time was spent as a slow moving bottom feeder, using its beak to crush the shells of crustaceans and mollusks. Far more striking, however, was its size, 15ft long from head to tail, which earned this turtle the honor of being the largest known turtle to ever live. It’s theorized to have gone extinct due to the Western Interior Seaway drying out.
