Chalicotherium is a very, very interesting animal and definitely is proof that the Cenozoic is no less interesting than any other era. As you can see from the pictures, Chalicotherium looked like a weird mix between a gorilla and a horse. Funny enough, it was actually a horse. Yes, somehow, that is a horse. Chalicotherium could stand up to eat high branches, and used its long claws to rake up fibers and foliage. Because of these therizinosaur-like claws, it had to walk on its knuckles. You may have noticed, but yes, that does mean that this horse didn’t have hooves. Chalicotherium isn’t even the oddest ungulate out there. Modern day whales are also ungulates, specifically they are meat eating, even toed ungulates. That’s a conversation starter if I ever heard one.
