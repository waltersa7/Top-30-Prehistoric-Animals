<p><strong>Name: </strong>Doedicurus clavicaudatus, “club-tailed pestle”</p>
<p><strong>Family: </strong>Glyptodontidae (large armidillo-like mammals)</p>
<p><strong>Lived: </strong>Mid-Holocene (2 million to 7,000 years ago), Patagonia</p>
<p><strong>First Described: </strong>1847, South America</p>
<p><strong>Size: </strong>Approx. 5ft tall and 12ft long, and weighed 3,100lbs </p>
<hr>
<p>Doedicurus was a large armadillo-like mammal that had a spiked club on its tail that it would use similarly to an Ankylosaurus. It also had a heavy and strong carapace. It was essentially the Cenozoic version of an Ankylosaurus. It was a herbivore and likely grazed, but it had teeth which were poor at chewing grass, implying a slow metabolism (and possibly a longer lifespan than most animals from the time due to this). Its size is attributed to gigantism, a result of its bulk feeding habits, intraspecies competition, and being introduced to the Americas which were previously isolated, as a defense against new, large predators like Smilodon (to which some fossilized signs of predation have been attributed). However, Smilodons were not the most terrifying predator it faced; it’s theorized to have gone extinct due to a combination of human hunting and the impending Ice Age.</p>
