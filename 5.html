This dinosaur is fairly controversial. It’s more commonly referred to as Becklespinax, however, Altispinax is the currently accepted name. At least, the most accepted among those who believe it actually existed, which is also still up for debate. Either way, Becklespinax and Altispinax are scientifically synonymous, so it doesn’t really matter what you call it. It’s known from fragmentary fossil evidence, and we only really know that it had a sail. My personal preference for this dinosaur stems from the media surrounding it, rather than the dinosaur itself. A spin-off TV show for Jurassic World exists called Jurassic World: Chaos Theory and this show makes use of the controversy in an interesting way. By calling the dinosaur “Becklespinax”, an invalid genus, the artists had more creative control. This choice enabled them to design a very striking image of a spiky, spiny theropod that most people know Altispinax to be, altering public perception of the dinosaur…despite scientific inaccuracy. It’s always interesting how media interacts with science, and that relationship made this dinosaur pretty interesting, but for completely different reasons than the others.
