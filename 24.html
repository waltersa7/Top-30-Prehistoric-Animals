Oviraptor is possibly one of the most misunderstood dinosaurs of all time. It’s name translates to “egg thief”, and it was named this way due to how it was discovered. A single Oviraptor skeleton, mostly complete, was found in a formation alongside several eggs - in fact, this seemed to have been a nesting ground. The dinosaur was described as a scheming and diminutive one which stole and ate eggs from other dinosaurs’ nests. The Oviraptors skull had been crushed by a larger dinosaur, making it hard to discern certain features such as its teeth (or lack thereof - they didn’t have any), which would have helped clear up what their diet actually was. In reality, Oviraptor cracked open and ate nuts and shellfish with its beak, which constituted most of its diet. Oviraptor did not eat eggs, at least not as part of its typical diet. This Oviraptor was a parent who died protecting its eggs, and 70 million years later, it was falsely accused of being a thief for it.
