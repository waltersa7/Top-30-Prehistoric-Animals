In 2005, paleontologist Xu Xing was instructed to re-enact the exhumation of fossils from a known sauropod, Sonidosaurus, for a documentary. When Xing dug out a thigh bone, he and the film crew were shocked to realize that this was no Sonidosaurus, nor was it a sauropod at all; he just discovered the largest known oviraptorosaur to ever live. Gigantoraptor was absurdly large; in fact, the 16-20 ft range is actually from a specimen which may not have been fully matured, so it’s entirely possible that they were far larger than we know. Gigantoraptor has several differences from typical oviraptorosaurs. They are typically smaller dinosaurs, so its size indicated that it deviated remarkably from the basal position of this clade. Smaller dinosaurs are usually more bird-like as most close relatives of modern day birds tend to be smaller. But Gigantoraptor deviates in this manner as well, being more “bird-like” than others of its kind. Conversely, it likely had less feathers due to its size; a larger body allows for body heat to be used for temperature regulation rather than feathers, which smaller animals use. (This is also why whales, elephants, and tyrannosaurids are naked). But they certainly did have feathers as evidenced by a pygostyle. The final strange feature of this animal was its elongated hindlimbs. Typically, the larger a theropod is, the hindlimbs will be stockier to withstand the mass of the body. This means that Gigantoraptor was one of few cursorial theropods of its size. These deviations led to it being reclassified as a sub-clade of oviraptorosauridae, caenagnathidae, rather than a basal oviraptosauridae as originally described.
