Despite being known from only one complete specimen, Carnotaurus is one of the best understood theropods from the Southern Hemisphere. It’s known for its bull-like horns atop its head. Once it was theorized to have used these to ram prey, but nowadays it is believed to have been for interspecies competition and mating display. In reality, these dinosaurs didn’t need to ram their prey because they had one of the strongest bite forces proportional to their head size, and are theorized to have been the single fastest land predator to ever live. Proportionally, Carnotaurus had some of the smallest arms of all theropods - they basically had two nubs. However, it’s theorized that these nubs were used in mating displays. As depicted in my personal favorite dinosaur documentary, Prehistoric Planet, they may have flailed their little vestigial  arms around in a strange “dance” to impress females. The clip can be found on YouTube here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPFYJ8ZWSoU">here</a>. If you found that clip interesting, there are 3 entire seasons of Prehistoric Planet and it’s a great show for anyone, even non-paleo nerds. In fact, this clip is so famous that Carnotaurus is stereotyped as “cute” despite its appearance, and led to Carnotaurus being one of the most popular and beloved dinosaurs.
