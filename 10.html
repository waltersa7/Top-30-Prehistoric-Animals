This is the biggest bird to have ever lived, reaching wingspans of 23ft long. Argentavis also would have been highly intelligent, having a low r factor for a bird. A high r factor indicates high rates of reproduction, which also means lower “quality” offspring. Animals that have many offspring like rabbits and deer tend to be quantity over quality. For low r value animals like dolphins, chimps, and humans, we are quality over quantity. Argentavis only laid one or two eggs at a time, indicating high quality offspring, especially considering most birds lay far more than that. They also lived much longer than most birds do, theorized to have been between 50 and 100 years. It’s almost a shame that Argentavis died out before humans, (ironically, they died out almost at the same time the first hominids were evolving; we were so close) because they’d have made excellent companions. They could travel hundreds of miles, gliding on their wings, were highly intelligent, and could live for about as long as we could. An interesting limitation of Argentavis was that it required wind to fly, rather than being able to fly on its own. This is likely at least partially due to it’s size.
