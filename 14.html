Since we’re on a hadrosaur kick, here’s a third - Ouranosaurus. Ouranosaurus has many traits atypical of hadrosaurids, such as a thick sail on its back. Ouranosaurus lived in environments that seem inherently paradoxical, lush river systems within dry deserts. Because of this unique environment, paradoxical traits occur. Ouranosaurus may have stored water in the hump on its back, like a camel, to stay hydrated even in dry environments. However, Ouranosaurus was actually a semi-aquatic animal which used water as cover from predators. It’s always interesting when animals have traits that seemingly juxtapose each other. It’s actually something that exists today as well - the Perentie. Despite having water-efficient kidneys to survive long droughts and shade seeking behaviors, it has a flat tail for swimming, can remain submerged for a long time, and hunts marine animals. Similar to Ouranosaurus, this juxtaposition is born out of it’s unique environment, the coast of Australia.
