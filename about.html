    <p>This website is my final project for INF 286!
    <br><br>
    I decided that I would be best doing my final on something that I know alot about, which is, of course, prehistoric animals. Ever since I was a kid, I've been obsessed with wildlife. After watching Jurassic Park at 3 years old, I became infatuated with that wildlife which we will never be able to see again.
    <br><br>
    This top 30 has been curated over nearly 20 years of my paleo obsession, so hopefully this is elite ball knowledge, and hopefully you found your own favorite prehistoric animal along the way (please email me what it is at aubrey.r.walters@gmail.com).
    <br><br>
    If you're reading this, please please please please please give me 5 million points on my final Dr. Neal.
