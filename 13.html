Olorotitan challenged perceptions about the climate that dinosaurs could live and thrive in when they were alive. As reptiles, many people assume that dinosaurs did not live in the cold, and that the Earth was temperate year round. In fact, dinosaurs were not cold-blooded, but warm-blooded. They could live perfectly fine in the cold if they were adapted for it, and one such example is Olorotitan, a hadrosaur found in Russia. 2003 was long after it was known that dinosaurs were warm blooded, but we didn’t have many examples of cold-weather dinosaurs since tropical regions have better conditions for preservation. Olorotitan had a large crest atop its head that functioned as a resonating chamber, connected to complex nasal passages, allowing them to make loud horn-like calls. Knowing that dinosaurs are birds, one heavily debated theory is that they may have sung like birds do. There is little evidence for this, but the horn on Olorotitans head may provide evidence that it sung deep, resonating melodies that echoed across the tundra, songs that we will never hear.
