Imagine a baboon that is big enough to stand eye to eye with you…on all fours. The most interesting thing about Dinopithecus is that this isn’t theoretical, it’s something that likely did happen 2 million years ago, as Dinopithecus lived alongside early humans and may have even predated on them. Dinopithecus was very similar to modern baboons, with high intelligence and social behaviors. Dinopithecus would have likely been one of the most intelligent carnivores within their ecosystem, making them an apex predator. They wouldn’t only eat meat, though, as they were known to eat berries and some plants.  </p>
