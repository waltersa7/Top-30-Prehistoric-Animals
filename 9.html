Convergent evolution is when two species that are not closely related develop the same trait. Ankylosaurids and sauropods are similar only in that they are dinosaurs, and nothing else. Even smaller sauropods are quite large, and their size would have been their main mode of defense. Shunosaurus decided it thought Ankylosaurus was so cool, that it was gonna have a large club at the end of it’s tail even though it definitely didn’t need it, already one of the largest dinosaurs in its ecosystem - and sauropod tails could cripple potential predators without a club, anyways. Shunosaurus is the only club-tailed sauropod, and would have used it to defend itself from predators. Because of its large size, this club would have had the force of a semi-truck hitting you head on at 120mph. Interestingly, Shunosaurus also had a short neck for a sauropod and nobody knows exactly why this was the case either. Altogether, a very mysterious dinosaur with several unique traits that we do not fully grasp the purpose of.
