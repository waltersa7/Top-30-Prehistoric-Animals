This is a beast that needs no introduction. Spinosaurus was the largest terrestrial dinosaur in mass, and also the longest. In pop culture, Spinosaurus is depicted as a foil to T. rex - “the only other dinosaur strong enough to beat the tyrant lizard king”. This has led to an ever present debate on who would win, T. Rex or Spinosaurus. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this is not even a close fight, but the winner depends on territory. Spinosaurus was not made for land. It actually would have been clunky on land, with flipper-like feet and an awkward gait. On land. T. rex destroys Spinosaurus. In the water, though, it’s a different beast. Spinosaurus swam like a crocodile, and was the apex predator in the water. It could hold its own against the largest marine predators of its time, and would have had an advantage over T. rex in its home base. T. rex wasn’t a pushover in the water, but Spinosaurus wins.
