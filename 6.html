<p><strong>Name: </strong>Liaoningosaurus paradoxus, "paradoxical lizard from Liaoning”</p>
<p><strong>Family: </strong>Ankylosauridae (herbivores with a low posture and keratinous armor, like Ankylosaurus)</p>
<p><strong>Lived: </strong>Early Cretaceous (125 to 118 million years ago), China</p>
<p><strong>First Described: </strong>2001, China</p>
<p><strong>Size: </strong>Approx. 1ft long, less than a foot tall, and weighed less than 5lbs. The only specimen found was a baby, though, so it was certainly larger matured.</p>

Typically, ankylosaurids are larger, strong armored dinosaurs that brushed off most predation with ease. Even the T. Rex couldn’t do much to them, as evidenced by no fossil record of an Ankylosaurus with T. Rex bite marks despite the two living in the same area at the same time. This entry on the list is an ankylosaurid, but it’s actually the smallest animal on the entire list. Liaoningosaurus is one of the smallest ankylosaurids; short, stubby, round, and would have been T. Rexes chew toys if they lived at the same time. On the bright side, they were very cute, but that didn’t do them any favors. But they did have a trick up their sleeve. Ankylosaurids would have been heavy and potentially made poor swimmers, but Liaoningosaurus excelled at swimming. In fact, it lived an aquatic lifestyle where it ate fish (and was the only ankylosaurid to do so, actually) alongside a more conventional ankylosaurid diet. We know for sure that it ate fish because it actually was found well preserved enough that its stomach contents were discernable. Fun fact: this fossil was nicknamed “the glutton” by researchers because it was quite well fed. The existence of this fossil is due in large part to this animal also being found in the Jehol formation, like Jehelopterus. Liaoningosaurus also gave us a lot of insight about ankylosaurid growth. The only fossil found is of a baby, almost newborn, and it already had armor, which suggested that ankylosaurids were either born with armor, or developed it very early in life.
