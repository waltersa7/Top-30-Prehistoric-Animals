Mononykus is a very tiny dinosaur, but no less interesting than the others on the list. As its name suggests, it had one large claw on each of its arms. It's clear that this claw had no applications for hunting, only one claw can’t effectively grasp onto prey, and, frankly, Mononykus was clearly not built for predation. It was only 6lbs and had long legs that seemed built for running. So what was this single claw for? There are some extant animals with one claw, or only 2 with one very large one, and these animals tend to fit a specific niche - insectivores. Anteaters are one animal with this feature. Researchers found that it was likely that Mononykus was an insectivore and used this claw to dig out termite nests. Then, it had a long and thin snout that could fit into this hole, and an even longer tongue to reach as many termites as possible. This would make it the oldest known animal to show this behavior.
