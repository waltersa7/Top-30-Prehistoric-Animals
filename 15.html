Azdarchids are already the largest pterosaurs, and that makes the largest of the azdarchids, Quetzalcoatlus, the largest animal to have ever taken to the skies. On top of its size, it sported a spear-like beak that could help it to dispatch prey in mid-air. Many pterosaurs would have breeding grounds high up atop sea rocks where the adults mated. Then, when the eggs hatched, the newborns would immediately take to learning how to fly. One hunting behavior azdarchids like Quetzalcoatlus were famous for was opportunistically attacking swarms of newborn pterosaurs to eat as many as they could mid-air. As terrifying as they were aerially, they were a different beast on the ground. They stood taller than a giraffe, and walked slowly through the trees searching for prey. One may assume that, as pterosaurs, they were not made for hunting on the ground, but Quetzalcoatlus excelled. Once it spotted prey, it could gallop and reach respectable speeds.
