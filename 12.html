One of the first dinosaurs ever discovered, Iguanadon was originally thought to be a dragon when it’s bones were uncovered. While not a dragon, it is equally as cool. One interesting trait is that Iguanodon was bi-modal - it could stand upright or on all fours perfectly fine. It chewed grass using specialized grinding teeth, but despite being a plant-eater, this dinosaur could throw hands, quite literally. The most striking feature of Iguanodon is a large spike on the inside of its two front limbs, like a thumb. It used these spikes to defend itself from predators, standing up and jamming them into the attacker. This has given Iguanodon the public perception of a peaceful animal who just wants to be left alone - and you’d better leave it alone, because if you don’t, it throws a mean left hook.
