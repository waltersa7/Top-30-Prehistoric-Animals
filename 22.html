Sharks are one of nature's perfections; sharks were very similar to how they are today even before trees existed. They have some differences here and there, but it seems like nature just got it right the first time and they never needed to evolve, most species of shark are relatively similar. Now, take nature's perfect beady-eyed predator and make it 50ft long. That’s a Megalodon. Megalodons need no introduction. These giant sharks have piqued the interest of even casual paleo enjoyers, and for good reason. These animals were the apex of the apex, the rulers of the most inhospitable environment on Earth - the sea. They were so prolific that they lived almost everywhere where there was water, and spent 20 million years terrorizing pretty much every animal living in the water. It even hunted whales, and not the early whales that Palaeophis colossaeus hunted, but whales as big as the ones we have today, and it hunted them with ease. It’s babies were born already bigger than a human, its teeth are as big as your hand, its occipital ring twice the size of your head - and it lived everywhere. Teeth from Megalodon have been found on every single continent.
