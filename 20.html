<p><strong>Name: </strong>Arthropleura armata, "armored with joined ribs”</p>

<p><strong>First Described: </strong>1854, Scotland</p>
<p><strong>Size: </strong>Approx. 8.5ft long, 2ft tall. Weight is disputed.</p>

<p>
I purposefully cut out several Carboniferous animals due to the ick factor associated with bugs, but I could not in good conscience redact them all. I saved my favorite, Arthropleura, for a spot on this list. Arthropleura was the biggest terrestrial bug to ever live, bigger than a grown man. It was likely not a meat eater, but a detritivore, meaning it fed on dead organic material like dead wood and plant debris. Arthropleura lived at a time when oxygen levels were much higher than they are now, hence its size. It probably did not have any predators due to its size. There was not much life on Earth 300 million years ago, so Arthropleura was about as big as it got at the time.
