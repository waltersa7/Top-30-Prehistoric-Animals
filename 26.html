Phorusrhacos longissimus are colloquially referred to as “terror birds”, and this name is rather apt. Terror birds were apex predators across all of South America, and were probably pretty successful in this judging from the fact that they are known to have lived for 42 million years - that’s a very long lifespan for a species. They lived for so long and were so successful that there have been found other species of terror bird that lived in North America too. It was only when big cats moved into the area did terror birds lose their foothold as the king of South America, and they likely went extinct due to this competition. Their beaks delivered hatchet-like blows and, while they couldn’t fly, they could run extremely fast. Terror birds seemed to be the last raspy breath of the rule of dinosaurs - the last large theropod apex predator to rule its ecosystem in the footsteps of thousands before it. Unfortunately for terror birds, it’s a mammals world now.
